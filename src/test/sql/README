Here is a list symlinks we need to add to run the test

Run from src/test/sql directory

ln -s /usr/local/bin/shp2pgsql loader
ln -s /usr/local/bin/pgsql2shp loader
mkdir -p regress/00-regress-install/share/contrib
ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/postgis/2.1.7_1/share/postgis regress/00-regress-install/share/contrib/

This can probably be done in better way.

Then you can run a simple test.

./run_test.pl --verbose --topology topo_update
